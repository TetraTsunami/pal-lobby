The goal of this project is to create a web visualization similar to the [ARMS (2017) online lobby screen](https://youtu.be/sfXfBYKvayY?si=H0I9q-OjAlF5O-Bg&t=223), but for the various activities of my friends. For example, if a bunch of people are playing the same game on Steam, or in the same voice channel on Discord, they show up in the same room on the visualization. This is a fun way to see what your friends are up to, and to join them in their activities! 

Since the visualization is web-based and has lots of movement, it should be suitable for display on a TV or monitor.
